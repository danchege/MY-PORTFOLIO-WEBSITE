        <h2>Education Background</h2>
        <p>My education at secondary school ended in 2015 when I earned a B (plain) mean grade. Computer studies became a special subject for me, and I was able to attain a B+ (Plus) grade from that course. My initial passion for computers and programming created a pathway for my progress in Information Technology. I have expanded my skills since then by specializing in web technologies and programming, as well as database management, to reach expert competency in tech industries.<br><br>I attended Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology, where I pursued a Community Health and Development course from 2016 to 2020. During this period, I gained valuable knowledge in public health, community development, and problem-solving approaches to improve societal well-being. Although my academic background is in health and development, my passion for technology and innovation has driven me to explore and build a career in Information Technology, blending both fields to create impactful solutions.</p>
